                    VTOL UAV is this year's attempt at the Aerial Evolution Association of Canada's 2023
                    student competition. The mission is similar to last year's, with an increased focus
                    on high maneuverability in urban environments. Drawing on our lessons from the previous
                    year's competition, as well as observations on the War in Ukraine, our team has decided
                    on creating a hybrid drone, a vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial system
                    (VTOL UAV).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main reasons for the move are the fact that a high endurance platform is needed,
                    and any platform that relies on rotars to provide lift will be inherently less efficient
                    as the energy spent on creating forward momentum does not contribute to lift like it does
                    for an aircraft with wings. The VTOL ability is required for the urban air maneuverability
                    aspect. A lesson retained from the previous year is that while a hexarotor design does
                    provide excellent lift and reliability, its design is heavy and hinders the range and
                    agility of the platform. Switching to a VTOL UAV will allow us to move large distances fast,
                    and small distances with agility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Switching to this design has not been easy, as there are many design challenges that come
                    with VTOLs. Before that, we first needed to prove we can design an aircraft, and understand
                    the dynamics and manufacturing challenges. Given that our team heavily prioritizes flight
                    testing in realistic conditions, it would be inevitable that we would burn through a lot of
                    airframes. Thus, creating a wing in a traditional process like using balsa and monocoat would
                    require too much time to be practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead we opted to 3D print a wing using lightweight PLA. Specific challenges arose from
                    the need to create supports for the wing while ensuring a smooth continuous path for the
                    printer nozzle. We were able to 3D print an aerofoil with the profile of the NACA 4412 that
                    should be able to sustain a load factor of 3, with the ability to scale up this number should
                    we decide to create an air dominance platform instead of an air taxi. However, due to the
                    nature of laminated layers, we cannot accurately simulate how the system will behave. Luckily
                    it is dirt cheap and simple to create these wings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge now shifts to creating the rest of the airframe, implementing control surfaces,
                    installing onboard electronics for the onboard flight computer, C2 link, and payload. This
                    doesn't scratch the surface on the software challenges that we'll face, from creating a model
                    to represent our dynamic system, tuning said system, and then integrating the autonomous flight
                    system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to see what's in store for me and my team, and the sort of challenges we will face
                    and overcome. No one's ever changed the world overnight, but we have a garage, a soldering iron,
                    and many laptops with GPUs! As the winter approaches, I can't help but think that my biggest 
                    challenge will be figuring out how to stay warm when flight testing, and make sure none of the 
                    electronics exceed their operating temperatures....
