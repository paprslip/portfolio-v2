                    UT-CYCLONE was a project initiated by myself, and my friends at UTAT to develop a
                    long-range, heavy lift drone that could deliver payloads of 15 kg while remaining under
                    a total maximum take-off weight of 25 kg. It participated in the Aerial Evolution
                    Association of Canada's 2023 National Annual UAS Student Competition, where it won 2nd
                    for the Phase 1 Technical Design challenge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was my second time attending an AEAC competition, and my first a team lead. I was
                    also the pilot-in-command for our team, and to say it was nerve-wracking was an
                    understatement. We had too many things left we wanted to do. We wanted to test the
                    software more, retune the PID model that stabilized the drone, and switch over from our
                    test configuration to our flight configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we ran out of time. We had to go into competition with what we had, and
                    trust that we had engineered it to be enough to do its mission. We set up our drone,
                    and attempted task 1, which was a long range endurance flight and autonomous landing.
                    We did not perform to our expectations in this task. There were some bugs that occured
                    occasionally during testing that would prevent us establishing C2 link. Unfortunately we
                    had become an example of Murphy's Law. Troubleshooting took too long, and we ran out of
                    time to safely perform the flight, so we elected to use it as a test run for the following
                    day's Task 2 mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Task 2 is where I get to tell a story about great engineers, and great perseverence. To say
                    we were disappointed after Task 1 was an understatement. We spent all night running 3D printers,
                    and flight testing in an open field under the moonrise, flight testing, optimizing software, and
                    tweaking stability parameters. We rolled up to competition the next morning, set up our drone
                    in record time, and off it went to ferry passengers (Barbies and Kens) kilometers away in a
                    urban air taxi scenario. It performed BVLOS autonomous landings, takeoffs, and navigation, 
                    ferrying passengers around the airport at Alma. It was marvelous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On one particularly difficult BVLOS landing, the autopilot clipped a tree on takeoff, causing 
                    damage to one of the propellers. Following this event, the drone began experiencing sustained,
                    high-frequency vibrations that caused the propeller to stall, creating a thrust differential
                    that lowered the attitude of the drone and losing altitude. It nosedived. We were heartbroken,
                    watching our robot child nosedive into the woods from afar. But then, like a phoenix rising from
                    ashes, it appeared once again over the horizon, zipping away to its next destination in stable,
                    level flight. It then initiated a landing over the landing zone, but the landing occured too
                    quickly and in the wrong spot, landing in a marsh next to the landing zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our investigation determined that the damaged propeller created the thrust differential, but then
                    the system autonomously corrected for the required thrust. Eventually the propeller separated
                    entirely, removing the stall problems arising from turbulent air flow coming off the propeller.
                    The system then, autonomously, continued in level flight as a pentacopter, demonstrating the 
                    resiliency and survivability of our design. Watching UT-CYCLONE rise over the horizon after
                    nosediving was my proudest moment as an engineer. Queue the blasting of the Free Bird guitar solo!
